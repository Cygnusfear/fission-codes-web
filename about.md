## Powering microservices for Web3

Microservices are being used in the traditional web to build small, nimble, pieces of code that communicate to each other through messages.

Today, developers are deploying smart contracts that only talk to their own systems, or at best writing custom code to understand a particular contract's interfaces.

With FISSION, individual smart contracts can be reviewed, verified, and hardened - and have their interactions defined as messages.
